### [Project 1 Overview: Predicting Restaurant Star Ratings Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/shelrx/shelrx_predictingstarratings)

In this project, I produced two stacking model, incorporating the Multinomial Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression as base classifiers. The models differed by their meta classifiers, where one used a decision tree model and the other used the Gaussian Naïve Bayes model. I chose to train the models on the sparse matrix retrieved from using CountVectoriser on the original text training data. The predictions for each model are stored in a csv file.

Language: Python 3

### [Project 2 Overview: Predicting Ride Demand in New York City for TaxiDrivers](https://github.com/MAST30034-2021-S2/mast30034_2021_s2_project_1-shelanahrahman)

In this project I did as my first complete data science projec, I suggest a model that predicts the taxi demand in a certain time period and location. I did this by aggregating the combined NYC taxi data and FHVHV data by the median of the features.  Then, we visualise and analyse the geographic and time series data to retrieve any useful trends.  The features are selected through analysing their distribution of features in regards to the trip demand classificationand correlation between features.  Lastly, a random forest model was fitted against the final selected features and the hyper parameters were tuned through RandomSearchCV to improve its performance. For more details on the analysis done in this project, refer to the report linked in the read me file. I received a H1 (highest grading) for this project.

### [Project 3 Overview: Kris Kringle Generator](https://github.com/shelanahrahman/Kris-Kringle-)

This project was completed purely for fun. I created a Kris Kringle Generator that matches participants to a person to give a gift to and then sends an email to participants on this information. This method was created during lockdown where we could not physically pick a name from a box. Hence, this method allowed for complete randomness.

Language: Python 3
