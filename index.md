[Project 1 Overview: Predicting Restaurant Star Rating Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/shelrx/shelrx_predictingstarratings)
In this task, I produced two stacking model, incorporating the Multinomial Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression as base classifiers. The models differed by their meta classifiers, where one used a decision tree model and the other used the Gaussian Naïve Bayes model. I chose to train the models on the sparse matrix retrieved from using CountVectoriser on the original text training data. The predictions for each model are stored in a csv file.
